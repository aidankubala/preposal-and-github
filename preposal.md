# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Some ideas I have had for my final project were expanding pong or mario with a space-like element or another game like space invader. One idea that I had that I am not sure if I could do because of logistics and the like is making a custom control set for a game that I play. For instance I saw a youtube video a while back of a guy using bananas to play League of Legends. Obviously my project wouldn't be as gimmicky as that but I was thinking about doing something along that vein in terms of an physical project.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Just wondering if the idea that I had would be good enough for a final project, but other than that, no. Thanks!
